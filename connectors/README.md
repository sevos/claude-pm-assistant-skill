# PM System Connectors

Connectors implement the interface between generic PM workflows and specific project management systems.

## Adding a New PM System Connector

Each connector must implement the following operations to be compatible with the PM Assistant skill.

### Connector Interface

Every connector file should document and implement these core operations:

#### 1. Discovery: Establish Team and Project Context
- Detect if the project uses this PM system (MCP server, config file, user input)
- Find team/project identifiers
- Retrieve available workspaces, teams, or projects
- Get current user information

#### 2. Query: Search and Filter Issues
- Implement system-specific query syntax (filters, JQL, GraphQL, etc.)
- Support common filters: team, project, status, assignee
- Support hierarchy queries: parent/epic relationships
- Return paginated results

#### 3. Read: Retrieve Issue Details
- Fetch full issue data (title, description, acceptance criteria, metadata)
- Retrieve relationships (blocks, blocked-by, parent/child, relates-to)
- Get available statuses, labels, cycles/sprints
- Retrieve comments and history

#### 4. Create: New Issues
- Accept ticket data (title, description, labels, assignees, etc.)
- Map generic ticket types (Feature, Bug, Enhancement) to system labels
- Link to parent epic if needed
- Return created issue ID and link

#### 5. Update: Modify Existing Issues
- Accept issue ID and fields to update
- Preserve unchanged fields
- Update relationships (add/remove dependencies)
- Support description, labels, status, assignee changes

#### 6. Comments: Collaboration
- Create comments on issues
- Retrieve comment history

### Connector File Structure

Each connector should be a markdown reference file in `connectors/` with:

1. **System Detection** section
   - How to detect if project uses this system
   - Configuration examples (CLAUDE.md)

2. **Core Operations** section
   - Detailed documentation of each operation
   - API calls or MCP function names
   - Parameters and return values
   - Example workflows

3. **System-Specific Concepts** section
   - Terminology (e.g., Jira "projects" vs Linear "teams")
   - Data model differences
   - Limitations or caveats

4. **Common Workflows** section
   - Fetch epic with sub-tickets
   - Create epic with sub-tickets
   - Search and analyze multiple tickets
   - Propose and apply changes

5. **Error Handling** section
   - Common error scenarios
   - Remediation steps

### Example Connectors

- **linear.md** - Linear MCP server connector (currently implemented)
- **local-markdown.md** - Local markdown files in docs/tickets/ (currently implemented)
  - **local-markdown/quickstart.md** - Quick start guide and common operations
- **jira.md** (future) - Jira Cloud API connector
- **github.md** (future) - GitHub Issues API connector
- **azure-boards.md** (future) - Azure Boards connector

### Using Connectors in SKILL.md

The main skill file should:

1. Detect which PM system is active
2. Load the appropriate connector reference
3. Call the connector's documented operations
4. Use universal patterns from `analysis_patterns.md` regardless of system

Example detection pattern:
```markdown
## PM System Detection and Initialization

1. Check for available MCP servers
2. Check CLAUDE.md for explicit system declaration
3. Ask user if ambiguous
4. Load connector reference from `connectors/{system}.md`
```

### Terminology Mapping

Each connector should define how it maps generic PM concepts to its system:

| Generic Concept | Linear | Local-Markdown | Jira | GitHub |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Team/Project | Team + Project | Implicit in directory | Project + Boards | Organization + Repository |
| Issue Type | Label (Type/*) | Type field | Issue Type | Issue or Discussion |
| Sprint/Cycle | Cycle | (not supported) | Sprint | Milestone |
| Epic/Parent | Parent issue | Parent field | Epic | Milestone/Project v2 |
| Sub-task | Sub-ticket | Parent field | Sub-task | Nested issue (linked) |
| Dependency | Blocks/Blocked-by | Blocks/Blocked-by fields | Link (depends on, blocks) | Link (dependency) |
| Status | State | Status field | Status | State (Open, Closed) |
| Label | Label | Labels array | Label | Label |

## Implementation Notes

- All connectors should support the same analysis patterns (gap analysis, dependency mapping, etc.)
- Connectors should gracefully handle errors specific to their system
- Configuration should be discoverable from both MCP servers and CLAUDE.md files
- Return values should normalize across systems (e.g., all return issue ID + link)

## Testing a New Connector

1. Create the connector reference file with complete documentation
2. Update SKILL.md to support the new system in its detection logic
3. Test detection: Can the skill identify projects using this system?
4. Test operations: Can the skill create, read, update, and query issues?
5. Test with analysis patterns: Do gap analysis, dependency analysis, etc. work?
